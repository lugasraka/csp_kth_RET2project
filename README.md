# csp_kth_RET2project
The remnants that brought me back to the world of scientific computing (MATLAB and EES) during my master's studies. We tried to simulate annual energy production of concentrated solar power (CSP) plant in Morrocco. Thanks to all stubborn students (I refer to you, hey great team members of group 6!) who got 'accidentally' merged in this group, we managed to obtain marks close to perfection. What a memorable experience!

## data analysis and workflow
Important tools are MATLAB scripts (for calculating and iterating solar power every hour) + EES script (for generating energy production by means of steam-cycle with cascading types of expansions). Presentation slides and final report are provided in the same folder.
